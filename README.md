# medetect

This is a quick demonstration of how one could use a simple natural language processing setup to distinguish medically relevant messages from small talk.

Language is highly contextual, but large amounts of information can nonetheless be extracted from purely textual data. If we can successfully classify medically relevant messages in a patient-provider conversation, DeepScribe can filter out the small talk and irrelevant messages to decrease data storage costs, decrease computational NLP resources, and improve the efficiency of engineers developing core models by removing noise.

**Medetect (like "medical detection") is a small proof-of-concept that this can be done with even the most basic of machine learning tools.**
